# 24/7

Welcome to N3 studio! I hope you're ready to dedicate your life to the company’s success.

As a proud member of the company, you’ll carve out your daily agenda each morning. Your choices will shape your stress, energy, productivity, and perhaps… the tiny, insignificant piece of yourself you still own.

On your desk lie a few objects you can play with, each representing a different task for the day.

Most of them will remain on your agenda and loop for several days. Your health matters to us! That’s why we’ve restricted you to adding only one new task to your schedule per day so you won’t be overwhelmed. You’re welcome.

When night arrives, the day’s weight heavy on your shoulders… tired? Frustrated? Want to throw something away? Simply drag any unused object on the desk into the trash can.

Whatever you discard, it reflects your true desire… Oh, but you can’t throw away what’s already on your agenda. I’ve already reported those to your boss. Maybe think carefully before you put something on the schedule next time.

Good luck,
N426

# Controls

## Objects

Each object has a **Day Effect** (repeats automatically) and a **Night Effect** (single use).

- **Day**: MOUSE CLICK on objects to send to the clipboard. This will add them to your agenda loop, or DRAG a card from your clipboard and press BACKSPACE to remove it from your clipboard.
- **Next Stage**: Press SPACE to move on to the next stage (except Day, which is auto).
- **Night**: MOUSE DRAG unused objects into the Trash Bin on the table to discard them and apply the Night Effects. 
- **Effect View**: Use your mouse and HOVER over any object/card, your monitor will show the effect. You can use the side button"Switch Time" to switch the monitor between showing the Day or Night effect.

## Your Day

1. **Morning (Planning phase)**: Add **1 card** to your Action Track, remove **1 card**, or skip.

2. **Daytime (Auto)**: Cards on your Action Track trigger automatically according to the agenda loop. Beware that ENERGY decreases with each action!

3. **Night (Play Cards)**: Play Night Cards from your hand. Each card costs 2 hours of sleep. Go to sleep when finished or if Energy hits 0.

## Goal

There are **6 different endings** according to different levels of PROJECT PROGRESS, STRESS, ENERGY and PASSION (cooking). Plan carefully!
